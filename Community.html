					<br>
					<p>The Friendship Home Joyful Heart Event was held on October 19, 2024, 4: 00 pm at The Friendship Home Foundation, Inc., with the goal of spreading joy through a gift-giving program for orphans.

					The committee worked together to prepare and personalize the presents, with others contributing through planning, logistics, and hosting the event. 
					The objective of the program was to embody the spirit of giving and share God’s love with the community during the holiday season.</p>
				<br>
					<p>Participating in this event allowed me to reflect on the joy of giving and the importance of selfless service. 
					I initially expected the activity to be a simple task of distributing gifts, but I was deeply moved by the gratitude and smiles of the recipients, which made me feel fulfilled and humbled. 
					A memorable moment was seeing a child’s face light up as they received their gift, reminding me of the profound impact even small acts of kindness can have. 
					While the most challenging part was managing the distribution process to ensure fairness and efficiency, it was rewarding because it taught me patience and teamwork.

				<br>
					<p>This experience has influenced my perspective on generosity, teaching me that giving is not just about material things but also about sharing time, effort, and compassion. 
					I learned that even small gestures can create a ripple effect of positivity and hope. 
					I plan to apply this learning by seeking more opportunities to serve and give back to the community in meaningful ways. 
					I hope to stay involved in similar initiatives, whether as part of the Gift Giving Committee or by supporting other programs that spread joy and love to those in need.</p>
				<br>
					<p>Because of this Friendship Home Joyful Heart Event, I am more committed to embracing the spirit of giving and making a difference in the lives of others through acts of kindness and compassion.</p>
